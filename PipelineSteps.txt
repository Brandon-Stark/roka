Infile Preparation

	Integrated dates from excel file into fasta file to prep BEAST infile.
		Infiles =
		Scripts = 
	Added outgroup sequence to the Roka sequences to prep ML infile.
		Outgroup seq used = 

Sequence Alignment

	Aligned sequences with MAAFT locally. Command:
	
	mafft-linsi RokaOutgroup.txt > RokaOutgroupAligned.txt
	
	Alignment was checked visually in Geneious (trial version).


Maximum Likelihood Analysis: 
	1: all controls and all roka seqs (roka-nonia for roka that cluster with controls)
	2: Just 199 clustering roka seqs
	
	Infile = "full_env_aligned.fasta"
	
	Converted file to .phyx using SeqMagick. Command:
	seqmagick convert full_env_aligned.fasta full_env_aligned.phyx
	
	Performed with RAxML locally. Command:
	./raxml -f d -T 6 -s full_env_aligned.phyx -n topology -c 25 -m GTRCAT -p 344312987 
	
	OUTFILES:
	Tree topology = â€œRokaMLTree.topology"
