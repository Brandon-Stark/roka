# Maximum Likelihood Trees

Repo for `.newick` maximum likelihood trees generated by RAxML.

# HIV

* RAxML recognized the pipe as an argument delimiter, so for the ML tree of just the Roka sequences the outgroup taxa 
name had underscores used instead. Example: `>NCHADS124|env|roka|2014-12-17` became `>NCHADS124_env_roka_2014-12-17`.

* Roka viruses `NCHADS116`, `NCHADS171`, `NCHADS184` and `NCHADS185` cluster within control sequences. All other Roka 
viruses are monophyletic and closely related.

* Roka virus `NCHADS124` is basal to the rest of the Roka clade.

Here we find evidence of at least two introductions of HCV-1b into the Roka community at some point in time, with substantial propagation of one of the introduced clades, likely due to needle re-use given the exceptionally low amount of diversity seen within the clade. The two clades of HCV-1b circulating in Roka appear to be 1) NCHADS196, 186 and 235, and 2) all other Roka sequences. While NCHADS180 doesn't appear to group with other Roka sequences the bootstrap support is low. We note that more clades could become apparent with the inclusion of more control sequences. For instance NCHADS050, 161 and 156 group basally with the highly propagated clade, but are slightly more divergent than the rest of the sequences grouping within this clade. Therefore it is possible that 050, 161, and 156 represent more divergent members of this clade, or that they would form another clade if more control sequences were included and showed interdigitation with 050, 161 or 156.

The HCV-6e tree also indicates two clades that were propagated by needle re-use. There is generally more diversity within the major Roka clades, and there are multiple subclades of 2-4 taxa that group together with strong support. We probably don't want to read too much into this, but a possible hypothesis is that HCV-6e infections were propagated slower over more time, allowing more diversity to accrue, whereas the HCV-1b tree appears to be more consistent with major propagation right before sampling (thus not leaving much time for diversity to build).
