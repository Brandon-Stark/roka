# Maximum Likelihood Trees

Repo for `.newick` maximum likelihood trees generated by RAxML.

# HIV

* RAxML recognized the pipe as an argument delimiter, so for the ML tree of just the Roka sequences the outgroup taxa 
name had underscores used instead. Example: `>NCHADS124|env|roka|2014-12-17` became `>NCHADS124_env_roka_2014-12-17`.

* Roka viruses `NCHADS116`, `NCHADS171`, `NCHADS184` and `NCHADS185` cluster within control sequences. All other Roka 
viruses are monophyletic and closely related.

* Roka virus `NCHADS124` is basal to the rest of the Roka clade.

## Unrooted ML tree of Roka and control samples from NS5B sequences of HCV Genotype 1b
![](HCV/HCV1b_Unrooted.png)

Here we find evidence of at least three introductions of HCV-1b into the Roka community at some point in time, with substantial propagation of one of the introduced clades, likely due to needle re-use given the exceptionally low amount of diversity seen within the clade.   The three clades of HCV-1b circulating in Roka appear to be defined by: NCHADS180, the clade of three sequences including NCHADS196, and finally the clade that appears to have been propagated the most (contains the majority of sequences sampled from Roka). We note that while there are at least three apparent clades, there could be more that would become apparent with the inclusion of more control sequences. For instance NCHADS050, 161 and 156 group basally with the highly propagated clade, but are slightly more divergent than the rest of the sequences grouping within this clade. Therefore it is possible that 050, 161, and 156 represent more divergent members of this clade, or that they would form another clade if more control sequences were included and showed interdigitation with 050, 161 or 156. 

## Unrooted ML tree of Roka and Control samples from NS5B sequences of HCV Genotype 6e
![](HCV/HCV6e_Unrooted.png)

The tree of 6e genotypes shows relatively more diversity within samples from Roka than we see from either the HIV trees or from the HCV 1b trees. While the HCV-1b and the HIV trees indicate at least one highly propagated clade with very little diversity within the clade, the HCV-6e tree shows a greater numbers of clades circulating in Roka (perhaps 7 or more) with each clade having relatively higher amounts of diversity within the clade than we see within HCV-1b clades. We think that the HCV-6e tree represents something closer to the 'null expectation,' namely, what a tree would look like for a community like Roka experiencing natural transmission only. While small community size would likely limit the numbers of circulating clades, within clade diversity would develop over the course of natural infections.

We hypothesize that HCV-6e was already the prevalent genotype circulating via natural transmission in Roka before needle-transmission amplified infection transmission. While some small clades of HCV-6e may have still been propagated more by needle-reuse (for instance the clade including NCHADS162), it appears that needle re-use contributed more to the propagation of the HCV-1b genotype in Roka than to HCV-6e.
